have timer start with the "begin" button on welcome screen

- timer will run for 60 seconds

    - if the user finished before 60 seconds
        - timer is cancelled

    - if the time expires
        - use the answers in the tempGameArray  
        - use the lengthofquiz and minus the tempGameArray.length = questions unanswered
        - determine the grade using, lengthofquiz / (tempGameArray.length + questions unanswered)
        - display the incorrect answers from tempGameArray
        - make a function to
            - display the questions unanswered
                - will probably need to access the original array to get this info



===================================

var lengthOfIncompleteQuiz;


if user answers 4 questions correctly
    - tempGameArray will have a length of 5 and 4 correct answers
        - 6 unanswered questions from examArray;

        grade will be based on 

        for (var i = 0 ; i <tempGameArray.length; i++) {
            - if (tempGameArray[i].selectedAnswer === undefined) {
                lengthOfIncompleteQuiz = i;
            }
        }

    here i have: 
    - how many questions are answered = lengthOfIncompleteQuiz
    - length of total quiz = lengthofquiz

    to display incorrect answers;
        - tempGameArray with incorrect answers()

        - new for loop to display the remaining quesitons with correct answers
            for (var i = lengthOfIncompleteQuiz; i < lengthofquiz; i ++) {
                display the questions
                display the correct answers 
                
            }
